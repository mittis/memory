# Copilot Instructions

## Code Quality & Style

### Code Standards
- Write **concise code** as possible - avoid unnecessary verbosity
- Follow **PEP8** formatting strictly for all Python code
- Use **short but precise comments** - explain the "why", not the "what"
- Remove **unused variables and code** immediately
- Follow **Python coding guidelines** (PEP 257, PEP 8)
- Implement **best practices** in all code patterns

### Code Organization
- Divide larger code into **several files** where necessary
- Use **multiple classes** to organize functionality logically
- Group related functions and classes into dedicated modules
- Maintain clear separation of concerns across modules

## Framework & Technology

### Web Framework
- Use **Python Flask** for all web services

- Keep interface simple and uncluttered
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes

## Documentation

### README.markdown
- Provide **installation instructions** clearly and step-by-step
- Keep README **concise and always up-to-date** with code changes
- Include quick start guide and basic usage examples
- Document dependencies and system requirements
- Provide troubleshooting section if applicable
- Update README with every significant code change

## Development Workflow

- Test code thoroughly before committing
- Ensure all dependencies are documented
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Review and refactor regularly to maintain quality
